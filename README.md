## Introduction

Search algorithms are a fundamental aspect of computer science, playing a critical role in problem-solving across various domains. This repository offers a hands-on exploration of these algorithms, providing both theoretical insights and practical Python implementations.

## Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is a search algorithm that explores a graph by starting at the root node and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- **Use Cases:** Solving mazes, puzzle games, topological sorting.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is a search algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

- **Use Cases:** Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, web crawlers, social networking searches.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)

### Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

UCS is an extension of BFS that considers the cost of the path, making it suitable for finding the lowest-cost path.

- **Use Cases:** Route planning, AI decision-making, robotics navigation.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)

### Best First Search

Best First Search uses a heuristic to determine the most promising path, balancing exploration and exploitation.

- **Use Cases:** AI pathfinding (e.g., A*), puzzle solving, game AI.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)
